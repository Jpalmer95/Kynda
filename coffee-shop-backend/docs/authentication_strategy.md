# User Authentication Strategy

This document outlines the user authentication and account management strategy for the Kynda Coffee E-commerce platform.

## 1. Primary Reliance on Shopify Customer Accounts

For user authentication, order history, saved addresses, and general account management, the Kynda Coffee platform will primarily rely on **Shopify's built-in customer accounts system**.

**Rationale:**

*   **Security & Robustness:** Shopify provides a secure, battle-tested authentication system, handling password management, account recovery, and protection against common web vulnerabilities. Replicating this would be complex and introduce unnecessary security risks.
*   **Seamless Customer Experience:** Customers familiar with Shopify will have a consistent experience. If they already have a Shopify account with other stores, they might benefit from a more streamlined login/checkout process.
*   **Reduced Development Overhead:** Leverages existing Shopify infrastructure, significantly reducing the development and maintenance burden on the custom backend.
*   **PCI Compliance for Payments:** User accounts are integrated with Shopify's checkout, which is PCI DSS compliant for payment processing.
*   **Order History & Saved Addresses:** Shopify natively handles order history and saved shipping/billing addresses associated with customer accounts.

## 2. User Interaction Flow

*   **Account Creation/Login:**
    *   Customers can create an account or log in during the Shopify checkout process.
    *   Shopify's standard account creation and login pages will be used.
    *   Links to "Login" or "Create Account" on the custom frontend (e.g., in the navigation header) should redirect to the Shopify account pages (e.g., `your-shopify-store.myshopify.com/account/login`).
*   **Order History & Address Management:**
    *   Authenticated customers can view their order history and manage their saved addresses directly through their Shopify account page (e.g., `your-shopify-store.myshopify.com/account`).
*   **Checkout:**
    *   If a customer is logged into their Shopify account, their saved information (addresses, possibly payment methods if Shopify supports it for the chosen gateways) can pre-fill during checkout, speeding up the process.

## 3. Backend Considerations

*   **No Custom User Database:** The custom Node.js/Express.js backend **will not** maintain its own user database for authentication (e.g., storing usernames, hashed passwords).
*   **API Authentication (Future):** If the custom backend needs to provide protected APIs for logged-in users (e.g., for highly specific custom features not manageable through Shopify data), a separate API authentication mechanism would be required. This could involve:
    *   **Shopify Multipass:** For redirecting users from the custom application to Shopify and logging them in seamlessly (requires Shopify Plus).
    *   **OAuth/JWT with Shopify as IdP:** A more complex setup where Shopify acts as an Identity Provider.
    *   However, for the current scope focusing on menu, ordering, and merchandise, direct user authentication on the custom backend is **not planned**. The interaction with Shopify (e.g., cart creation) is session-based on the frontend and doesn't require the backend to authenticate individual Shopify customers directly for these operations.
*   **Admin Authentication:** Authentication for any backend administrative dashboards or protected operational endpoints (if built) would be separate and require its own robust authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or a dedicated admin user system with strong password policies and MFA), and is outside the scope of customer authentication.

## 4. Frontend Implications

*   The React frontend should provide links that direct users to the appropriate Shopify account pages for login, account creation, and account management.
*   The frontend does not need to handle user registration forms or password management.
*   User-specific data that is displayed on the frontend (like personalized greetings if a user is known) would typically be fetched based on Shopify session data on the storefront or via JavaScript SDKs provided by Shopify if applicable, rather than direct backend authentication.

By leveraging Shopify's customer account system, Kynda Coffee can offer a familiar and secure account management experience while minimizing custom development complexity and security responsibilities.
