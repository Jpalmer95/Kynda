# Deployment, CI/CD, and Monitoring Plan

This document outlines the strategy for deploying, continuously integrating/delivering, and monitoring the Kynda Coffee e-commerce website, encompassing both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express.js) applications.

## 1. Hosting Platform Recommendations

### 1.1. Frontend (React Application)

*   **Recommended Platform: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Optimized for Next.js/React:** While our current frontend is plain React (Create React App), Vercel offers first-class support for React applications and is the ideal platform if a future migration to Next.js (for SSR/SSG benefits) is considered. It handles CRA deployments excellently too.
        *   **Global CDN:** Vercel deploys static assets to a global Edge Network, ensuring fast load times for users worldwide.
        *   **Integrated CI/CD:** Automatic deployments on Git push, with preview deployments for every branch/PR.
        *   **Serverless Functions:** Easy to add serverless API routes if needed for simple backend tasks directly alongside the frontend.
        *   **Ease of Use:** Very developer-friendly interface and CLI.
        *   **Analytics:** Built-in analytics for traffic and performance (Vercel Analytics).
        *   **Custom Domains & SSL:** Simple setup for custom domains with free automatic SSL certificates.
*   **Alternative:** Netlify (similar benefits for static/Jamstack sites).

### 1.2. Backend (Node.js/Express.js Application)

*   **Recommended Platform: [Render](https://render.com/)**
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Ease of Use:** Simple to deploy Node.js applications directly from a Git repository.
        *   **Managed Services:** Offers managed PostgreSQL databases, Redis, private networks, and background workers, allowing for easy scaling and addition of services.
        *   **Integrated CI/CD:** Auto-deploys on Git push.
        *   **Predictable Pricing:** Clear pricing structure.
        *   **Docker Support:** Supports Dockerized applications if needed for more complex setups in the future.
        *   **Health Checks & Zero-Downtime Deploys:** Built-in.
*   **Alternative: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)**
    *   **Reasoning:** A long-standing PaaS provider with excellent Node.js support and a large ecosystem of add-ons. While its free tier has changed, it remains a solid option. Render is often seen as a more modern and cost-effective alternative for many use cases.
*   **Alternative (Advanced): AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service**
    *   These offer more control and scalability but come with increased complexity in setup and management. Recommended if the team has existing expertise or specific needs for these ecosystems.

### 1.3. Database (PostgreSQL)

*   **Recommended: Managed Database Service**
    *   **If using Render for backend:** Use Render's managed PostgreSQL service.
        *   **Reasoning:** Simplifies infrastructure management, co-locates database with the backend (reducing latency if in the same region), handles backups, scaling, and maintenance.
    *   **Dedicated Providers (if not using Render's DB or for more features):**
        *   **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/database):** Provides managed PostgreSQL with additional features like real-time capabilities and auto-generated APIs (though we might not use all features).
        *   **[Neon](https://neon.tech/):** Serverless PostgreSQL, good for varying loads and developer experience.
        *   **[Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/):** Robust, scalable, and feature-rich, but more complex to manage.
        *   **[Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/postgresql):** Similar to RDS, for GCP users.
    *   **Reasoning for Managed Service:** Offloads database administration tasks (backups, patching, scaling, security), allowing the team to focus on application development. Ensures high availability and reliability.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Outline

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying both the frontend and backend applications.

### 2.1. Triggering the Pipeline

*   **Production Deployment:** Git push or merge to the `main` (or `master`) branch.
*   **Staging/Preview Deployment:** Git push or merge to a `staging` or `develop` branch. For Vercel (frontend) and potentially Render, every pull request can also automatically generate a preview deployment.

### 2.2. Recommended Tools

*   **Platform-Specific CI/CD:**
    *   **Vercel:** Provides its own highly efficient CI/CD for frontend deployments, triggered by Git pushes.
    *   **Render:** Also has built-in auto-deploy from Git for backend services.
*   **General-Purpose CI/CD Tool (if more customization is needed or for a unified pipeline): [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Deeply integrated with GitHub repositories. Highly configurable with a vast marketplace of actions. Can manage both frontend and backend pipelines. Free for public repositories and generous free minutes for private ones.

### 2.3. Key Pipeline Steps

A separate pipeline will be configured for the frontend and backend.

**Frontend CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Vercel or GitHub Actions deploying to Vercel):**

1.  **Trigger:** Push to `main` (production) or `staging`/PR branch (preview).
2.  **Checkout Code:** Fetch the latest code from the repository.
3.  **Setup Environment:** Configure Node.js environment.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
5.  **Lint:** Run ESLint or other linters (`npm run lint`).
6.  **Run Unit & Integration Tests:** `npm test` (executes Jest tests with React Testing Library).
7.  **Build Application:** `npm run build` (creates an optimized static build of the React app).
8.  **Deploy:**
    *   **Vercel:** Vercel automatically handles deployment from the connected Git repository and branch. For PRs, it creates preview deployments.
    *   **GitHub Actions to Vercel:** Use the [Vercel CLI Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vercel-action) to deploy the build output to Vercel.
9.  **(Optional) E2E Tests:** After deployment to a preview or staging environment, trigger E2E tests (e.g., Cypress/Playwright) against that environment.
10. **(Optional) Notify:** Send notifications (e.g., Slack, email) about deployment status.

**Backend CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Render or GitHub Actions deploying to Render):**

1.  **Trigger:** Push to `main` (production) or `staging` branch.
2.  **Checkout Code:** Fetch the latest code.
3.  **Setup Environment:** Configure Node.js environment.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install`.
5.  **Lint:** Run ESLint (`npm run lint` - if configured).
6.  **Run Unit & Integration Tests:** `npm test` (executes Jest tests, potentially with Supertest for API integration).
7.  **Deploy:**
    *   **Render:** Render automatically pulls changes from the connected Git branch and redeploys the service. It typically handles installing dependencies based on `package.json` and starting the application using the defined start command (e.g., `npm start`).
    *   **GitHub Actions to Render:** Use Render's [deploy hooks](https://render.com/docs/deploy-hooks) triggered by a curl request from GitHub Actions after tests pass, or use Render's Git integration directly.
8.  **(Optional) Database Migrations:** If using a database directly managed by the backend (currently not the case, but for future reference), run database migrations here.
9.  **(Optional) E2E Tests:** Trigger E2E tests against the staging/production backend.
10. **(Optional) Notify:** Send deployment status notifications.

## 3. Monitoring and Logging Plan

### 3.1. Frontend (React Application)

*   **Web Analytics: [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics)**
    *   **Reasoning:** If deploying to Vercel, it's built-in, privacy-focused, and provides insights into traffic and user behavior without performance impact.
    *   **Alternative:** Google Analytics, Plausible Analytics.
*   **Error Tracking & Session Replay: [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) or [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)**
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Sentry:** Excellent for capturing and aggregating frontend JavaScript errors, providing stack traces and context.
        *   **LogRocket:** Offers session replay capabilities, allowing you to see what the user did leading up to an error, along with error tracking and performance monitoring.
    *   **Integration:** Add their SDKs to the React application.
*   **Performance Monitoring:**
    *   **Vercel Analytics:** Provides Core Web Vitals.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools:** For local performance profiling.
    *   **Sentry/LogRocket:** Also offer performance monitoring features (e.g., transaction tracing).

### 3.2. Backend (Node.js/Express.js Application)

*   **Application Logging:**
    *   **Winston (already integrated):** Continue using Winston for structured logging to console and files (e.g., `combined.log`, `error.log`).
    *   **Log Management Service (Production):**
        *   **Recommended:** [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/), [Logtail (via Better Stack)](https://betterstack.com/logtail), or [Datadog Logs](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/log-management/).
        *   **Reasoning:** Centralizes logs from potentially multiple instances, provides powerful search and filtering, alerting on log patterns, and long-term retention.
        *   **Integration:** Configure Winston to stream logs to the chosen service (many have Winston transports or accept syslog). If deploying on Render, Render captures console output automatically, which can then be forwarded.
*   **Error Tracking: [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) or [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Same as frontend; provides excellent error aggregation, alerting, and context for backend exceptions.
    *   **Integration:** Use their Node.js SDKs, integrating with Express error handling middleware.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM - Optional, for deeper insights):**
    *   **Recommended:** [Datadog APM](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/), [New Relic APM](https://newrelic.com/platform/application-performance-monitoring).
    *   **Reasoning:** Provides detailed transaction tracing, database query performance, external API call monitoring, and helps identify performance bottlenecks. Can be more involved to set up and might have higher costs.
*   **Uptime Monitoring:**
    *   **Recommended:** [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com/), or platform-specific monitoring (Render/Vercel often have this).
    *   **Reasoning:** External services that periodically ping health check endpoints (e.g., `/health` on the backend) to ensure the application is responsive. Provides alerting on downtime.
*   **Shopify & Printful API Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor logs for errors related to Shopify API calls (e.g., rate limits, authentication issues, failed requests).
    *   Monitor logs for errors from Printful API calls.
    *   Set up alerts based on high error rates or specific error codes from these services.

## 4. Environment Management

Distinct environments are crucial for a stable development and release process.

*   **Development (Local):**
    *   Developers run the frontend and backend on their local machines.
    *   Uses local `.env` files for configuration (e.g., connecting to a Shopify development store, Printful sandbox if available, local mock POS).
*   **Staging:**
    *   A deployed environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   Frontend deployed to a staging URL on Vercel (e.g., `staging.kyndacoffee.com` or a Vercel preview URL).
    *   Backend deployed to a staging service on Render.
    *   Connected to a Shopify development/staging store.
    *   Connected to a Printful test/sandbox account (if Printful offers one, otherwise careful use of the live account with draft orders).
    *   Used for UAT, E2E testing, and final review before production.
    *   Environment variables managed through the hosting platform's UI/CLI (Vercel, Render).
*   **Production:**
    *   The live environment for customers.
    *   Frontend deployed to the production domain on Vercel.
    *   Backend deployed to the production service on Render.
    *   Connected to the live Shopify store and live Printful account.
    *   Environment variables managed securely through the hosting platform's UI/CLI.

**Managing `.env` files:**
*   `.env` files are for local development only and are **never** committed to Git (ensured by `.gitignore`).
*   For deployed environments (staging, production), environment variables are set directly in the hosting platform's settings (e.g., Vercel project settings, Render environment group settings). This is a more secure practice.

## 5. Build Process

### 5.1. Frontend (React - Create React App based)

*   **Command:** `npm run build`
*   **Process:** This script (provided by Create React App) compiles the React application, including JavaScript (JSX, ES6+) and CSS, into a set of optimized static files (HTML, JS bundles, CSS bundles, images, etc.) in a `build/` directory.
*   These static files are what get deployed to Vercel.

### 5.2. Backend (Node.js/Express.js)

*   **No Explicit Build Step (for current JavaScript setup):**
    *   Since the backend is written in JavaScript and does not use TypeScript or a transpilation step, there isn't a "build" command in the same way as the frontend.
    *   **Deployment Process:**
        1.  The code is pushed to the Git repository.
        2.  The hosting platform (e.g., Render) pulls the code.
        3.  It runs `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies listed in `package.json`.
        4.  It then runs the start command specified in `package.json` (e.g., `npm start`, which executes `node src/server.js`).
*   **If TypeScript were used (Future Consideration):**
    *   A build step would be added: `npm run build` (e.g., `tsc` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript in a `dist/` directory).
    *   The `start` command would then be `node dist/server.js`.
    *   The deployment process would include running this build command before starting the server.

This comprehensive plan ensures that Kynda Coffee's application can be reliably deployed, maintained, and monitored, supporting its growth and stability.
