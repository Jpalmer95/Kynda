# Client Handover Package: Kynda Coffee E-commerce Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the key deliverables, comprehensive documentation, and areas for training and ongoing maintenance for the Kynda Coffee e-commerce platform. It serves as a guide for the Kynda Coffee team to understand the components of the system and how to manage them effectively post-launch.

## 2. Key Project Deliverables

The project successfully delivered the following core components:

1.  **React Frontend Application (`coffee-shop-frontend`):**
    *   Customer-facing website for browsing the menu, shopping for merchandise (including standard and customizable items), and managing cart functionalities.
    *   Integration with Shopify for checkout.
    *   User interface for selecting pre-made designs for customizable products.
    *   Display of featured items and product categories.
2.  **Node.js Backend Application (`coffee-shop-backend`):**
    *   API services to support frontend operations (menu, cart, product fetching).
    *   Integration with Shopify Admin API for product data and cart/checkout management.
    *   Webhook handling for Shopify order creation, enabling automated order forwarding.
    *   Integration with Printful API for drop-shipping customizable merchandise (order creation is currently mocked but designed for live integration).
    *   Security enhancements (Helmet, input validation examples, webhook verification).
3.  **Integrations:**
    *   **Shopify:** Core e-commerce platform for product management, customer accounts, order processing, and payment gateways (including crypto).
    *   **Printful:** For on-demand printing and drop-shipping of customizable merchandise.

## 4. Training Plan Outline for Kynda Coffee Staff

Training will empower Kynda Coffee staff to manage the e-commerce platform effectively.

### 4.1. Target Roles for Training

*   **Shop Manager / E-commerce Manager:** Requires comprehensive training on all relevant aspects.
*   **Marketing Staff:** Focus on product presentation, featured items, and understanding customization capabilities.
*   **Baristas / In-Store Staff (for POS interactions - future):** Training on how online orders appear in the POS system.

### 4.2. Key Training Topics

**A. Shopify Platform Management:**

*   **Product Management:**
    *   Creating and editing standard menu items (coffee, food).
    *   Creating and editing standard merchandise (self-fulfilled).
    *   **Crucial:** Setting up "Customizable Printful Products":
        *   Correctly assigning the `Printful_DS` vendor.
        *   Using the `customizable-printful` tag.
        *   Formatting SKUs as `PFUL-{PrintfulVariantID}` by looking up Printful Variant IDs.
    *   Tagging products as `featured-item` for homepage display.
    *   Managing collections, product descriptions, images, and pricing.
*   **Order Processing & Fulfillment:**
    *   Understanding the lifecycle of an order (online payment, POS order, drop-shipped order).
    *   Identifying which orders/items are self-fulfilled vs. Printful-fulfilled (checking vendor field, SKUs, or order notes).
    *   Processing self-fulfilled items (e.g., marking as fulfilled, adding tracking if shipped by Kynda).
    *   Understanding how Printful orders are automatically forwarded (via backend webhook).
    *   Reviewing Shopify orders for `customAttributes` (`_customArtUrl`, `_customArtName`) on line items to see chosen designs.
    *   Handling refunds, returns, and customer inquiries related to orders.
*   **Customer Account Management:**
    *   Assisting customers with account inquiries (Shopify handles creation/password resets).
*   **Payment Gateway Configuration:**
    *   Overview of connected payment gateways (Shopify Payments, Crypto.com Pay/Coinbase Commerce).
    *   Understanding how to view payment statuses and basic reconciliation.
    *   (Note: Detailed gateway configuration is usually a one-time setup but an overview is useful).
*   **Using Shopify Mobile App:** For on-the-go order viewing and management.

**B. Printful Dashboard Management:**

*   **Basic Overview:** Navigating the Printful dashboard.
*   **Order Status Monitoring:** Checking the status of orders automatically forwarded from Shopify.
*   **Product Templates:** Understanding how product templates (base product + design) are set up in Printful (if Kynda staff will manage these).
*   **Billing & Account:** Awareness of Printful billing for fulfilled orders.
*   **Issue Resolution:** How to contact Printful support for fulfillment-related issues.

**C. (Future) Headless CMS Management:**

*   If a headless CMS is integrated:
    *   Creating and updating content for pages like "About Us," blog posts, etc.
    *   Managing media assets within the CMS.

**D. Basic Troubleshooting & Support:**

*   **Identifying the Issue Source:** Is it a website display issue (frontend), an order processing issue (Shopify, backend, Printful), or a payment issue (Shopify, payment gateway)?
*   **Who to Contact:**
    *   For website bugs or backend issues: [Development Team contact/support channel].
    *   For Shopify platform issues: Shopify Support.
    *   For Printful fulfillment issues: Printful Support.
    *   For payment gateway issues: Respective gateway support.
*   **Information to Provide When Reporting Issues:** Screenshots, order numbers, customer details (if applicable), steps to reproduce the issue, browser/device information.

## 5. Post-Launch Support Recommendations

A post-launch support period is recommended to ensure a smooth transition and address any immediate issues that arise once the site is live.

*   **Duration:** Typically 2-4 weeks.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Bug Fixes:** Addressing any defects or issues in the custom-developed frontend or backend components that were not caught during testing.
    *   **Critical Issues:** Prioritized support for any issues that significantly impact core functionality (e.g., inability to place orders, checkout failures not related to payment gateways themselves, major display problems).
    *   **Guidance & Clarification:** Answering questions from Kynda Coffee staff as they begin to use the new system and manage administrative tasks.
*   **Exclusions (typically):** New feature requests, significant design changes, or issues stemming from third-party platforms (Shopify itself, Printful service, payment gateways – though guidance on who to contact would be provided).
*   **Communication Channel:** A dedicated email address or support ticketing system for reporting issues.
*   **Response Times:** Agreed-upon SLAs for different priority levels (e.g., critical, high, medium).

## 6. Ongoing Maintenance Pointers

To ensure the long-term health and security of the platform:

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly check the monitoring tools set up (as per `docs/deployment_devops_plan.md`):
        *   Frontend: Vercel Analytics, Sentry/LogRocket for errors.
        *   Backend: Log management service (e.g., Papertrail), Sentry for errors, UptimeRobot for availability.
    *   Pay attention to error rates, performance metrics, and server resource utilization.
*   **Dependency Updates (Backend Focus):**
    *   Periodically (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually) review backend Node.js dependencies for security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`).
    *   Update dependencies to their latest stable and secure versions, testing thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production. This is crucial for `express`, `helmet`, `shopify-api-node`, and other core libraries.
*   **Shopify & Printful Updates:**
    *   Stay informed about important updates, API changes, or new features from Shopify and Printful that might impact the integration or offer new opportunities.
*   **API Key Rotation (if applicable):**
    *   Follow best practices for API key security. If an API key is suspected of being compromised, or as part of a regular security policy, rotate API keys for Shopify and Printful and update them in the backend environment variables.
*   **Data Backups:**
    *   Core e-commerce data (orders, products, customers) is backed up by Shopify.
    *   Printful manages its own data.
    *   If a separate database (PostgreSQL) is used by the backend in the future, ensure its backup strategy (typically handled by the managed database provider) is in place and regularly verified.
*   **Security Audits:**
    *   Consider periodic security audits or vulnerability scans, especially if significant new features are added or the threat landscape changes.

This handover package aims to equip Kynda Coffee with the knowledge and resources needed to successfully operate and maintain their new e-commerce platform.
